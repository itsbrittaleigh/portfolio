        <h1><span aria-hidden>üëãüèº</span> Hello, there!</h1>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm Britta Rodenbeck, a frontend engineer with a passion for crafting exceptional user experiences.
          With eight years in the dynamic world of web and software development, I‚Äôve had the privilege of
          working with startups and small companies, contributing to innovative projects that marry form
          with function.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in frontend engineering started with a curiosity about the intersection of design,
          code, and ethics. Over the years, I‚Äôve honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and immersed
          myself in cutting-edge frameworks like React and Vue. What sets me apart is not just the code I
          write, but the thoughtfulness I bring to the user interface, ensuring it not only meets functional
          requirements but delights all users‚Äîregardless of age, ability, language, or connection speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am driven by the belief that technology should be a seamless extension of human experiences.
          Whether it is optimizing performance for a quicker user interface or diving into the intricacies
          of responsive design, I thrive on the challenges that frontend development presents. I see each
          project as an opportunity to create something not just visually appealing but also highly
          functional and user-centric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having collaborated with diverse and distributed teams, I understand the importance of effective
          communication and teamwork in the design and development process. I bring not only technical
          expertise but also a collaborative spirit, valuing open dialogue and the exchange of  ideas that
          lead to innovative solutions.

        <h2><span aria-hidden>üìö</span> Beyond the code</h2>
        <p>
          Away from the keyboard, you‚Äôll find me hiking, biking, and camping in the warmer months and
          snuggling with my cat, a good library book, and hot chocolate in the colder ones. I am studying
          to become a certified sommelier, with my WSET 1 in hand and my WSET 2 scheduled for July 2024.
          I love exploring my new home city of Milwaukee, trying new bars and restaurants and finding
          which has the best cheese platter and curds.
